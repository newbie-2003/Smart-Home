# Smart Home Control Project

This project is a simple web application designed to control various devices within a smart home environment. Users can interact with the interface to toggle devices such as fans, bulbs, LEDs, and air conditioners (ACs). The application employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an intuitive user interface and to facilitate communication with a backend server.

## Features

- **Device Control**: Users can toggle the state of different devices and adjust settings such as fan speed, LED color, and AC temperature.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Changes made to device settings are reflected in real-time on the user interface, providing immediate feedback.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring compatibility with various screen sizes and devices.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes error handling mechanisms to manage failures in device control and communicate errors to the user.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the web page including device containers and control elements.
- **style.css**: Defines the styles for the web page, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive layout.
- **script.js**: Implements the logic for device control, handling user interactions, and communicating with the backend server.
- **Icons**: Contains images used as icons for different devices.
- **README.md**: Provides information about the project including its features, structure, and usage instructions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Interact with the device controls to toggle devices and adjust settings.
4. View the console for feedback messages and error logs.

## Dependencies

- **Fetch API**: Used for making asynchronous requests to the backend server.
- **Vercel API**: Backend server API endpoint for controlling devices.
